# Warehouse Inventory Optimization
## About the project 
Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking to close one of its storage facilities. To make a data-based business decision, the company wants suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely customer service. For this project I used MySQL Workbench to familiarize with the general business by examining the current data and isolating and identifying those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory.

## Summary
I used combination of SQL queries, and inventory management principles to analyze inventory in MySQL and provided actionable recommendations for improving inventory efficiency and customer service.
Analysis allowed to generate recommendations and suggestions for reorganizing  and reducing inventory while ensuring timely service to customers. These recommendations have included strategies such as reorganizing specific product lines into different warehouses  based on sales volumes and customer preferences.  Optimization of stock levels provides opportunity to close one of the warehouses.  Additionally, one  product was identified as candidate for being dropped from the product line.


## Approach
1. Data Analysis: I started by analyzing the customers order preferences  and the inventory data to identify patterns, trends, and areas for optimization. This involved querying the MySQL database to retrieve relevant information about inventory levels, product sales, customer demand.
     
2.	Joins, Temporary Tables and Aggregations: I used SQL queries to perform joins between different tables to consolidate relevant data. This involved joining and creating tables containing information about inventory levels, sales transactions, customer orders. I used aggregation functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG to calculate metrics like total sales, average demand.
 
3.	Filtering and Sorting: to identify specific inventory items or categories that need attention, I filtered and sorted the data based on various criteria. This included filtering items with low sales volume, high inventory levels.
 
4.	Performance Analysis: I asssesed the performance of each warehouse inventory by analyzing key metrics such as order processing times, sales volumes, stock levels, pricing.
